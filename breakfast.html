                Zazie's, a fantastic breakfast spot located in Cole Valley, attracts families and hipsters from all over the Bay Area. They're best known for their French Toast Tahiti and their fantastically-prepared, diverse-variety of eggs. This place is a MUST GO. Caution: Always crowded, maximum wait time is one hour and a half.

                Kevin's noodle house is by far the best pho place that I have tried(Mike). It serves a variety of differently prepared noodle dishes that are all deliciously filling. This place is a HAVE TO TRY! Benefits: There is always a lot of room, filling portions(tending to run for too much food), and quick serving.
